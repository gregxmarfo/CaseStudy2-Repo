## Introduction

[some text here]

## Installing Necessary Libraries

Install necessary packages if not installed:

```{r CaseStudy1.R, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('Load_libraries.R')
```

```{r Load_libraries.R, eval=TRUE}

```


## Importing Data

For this analysis we have access to two data sets:

1. EDSTATS_Country.csv  
    + Educational data for countries  
    + Fields Applicable to this analysis:
        * Country Code: Short code of the country, primary key and foreign key to GDP.csv
        * Income Group: Primary Income Group of the country, broken down to these discrete values: 
            - Low income
            - Lower middle income
            - Upper middle income
            - High income: OECD
            - High income: nonOECD
1. GDP.csv	
    + GDP Information by country. 
    + Raw data, processed in the Data Cleanup phase to remove blank or irrelevant rows
    + Fields Applicable to this analysis:
        * Country Code: Short code of the country, primary key and foreign key to EDSTATS_Country.csv
        * Ranking:  from 1-n of the country's GDP. 
        * Long Name: Long name of the country
        * GDP Ranking: GDP value for the country in a year. The data is supposed to be mostly for 2012, but the CSV file references that some of the data might come from 2010 or 2011. It is unclear which rows come from which year, which is noted in the analysis
        * Note: Rankings include only those economies with confirmed GDP estimates. Figures in italics are for 2011 or 2010.
     a. Includes Former Spanish Sahara.  b. Excludes South Sudan  c. Covers mainland Tanzania only. d. Data are for the area 
     controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.   e. Excludes Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  f. Excludes     Transnistria.

## Cleaning Data

In order to ensure we get correct results on our analysis some data cleanup is necessary since the EDP.CSV dataset contains many blank rows or rows that are irrelevant to this analysis. It might be possible to perform these exclusions at every calculation but the risk of a mistake is higher and the code would become much more complicated, so we will clean the code prior to analysis.

All of our cleanup is to GDP.CSV since EDSTATS_Country.csv is seemingly clean.

Cleanup is as follows:

1. Set column names to 'CountryCode','Ranking','Long Name','GDPInMillions2010_OR_2011_OR_2012','note' in order to be more readable (Purposes of these fields noted in the "Importing Data" section)
2. Deleted blank lines for country code and ranking since they did not contain meaningful data for this analysis and might throw off mean analysis.
3. Convert Ranking and GDP fields to numeric, removing any commas to ensure a good conversion

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('clean_data.R')
```

```{r clean_data.R, eval=TRUE}

```


## Analyzing Data

It is time for our data analysis in order to answer questions on these data. 

First we will merge the data based on the country shortcode and see how many of the IDs match between our two data sets:

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('Analysis1.R')
```

```{r Analysis1.R, eval=TRUE}

```

From these results we can see that we have 189 matching country codes between the data sets.

Now we will sort our merged data frame in ascending order by GDP (so United States is last). After the list is sorted we will find the 13th country in the resulting data frame:


```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('Analysis2.R')
```

```{r Analysis2.R, eval=TRUE}

```

The 13th country in the merged data after sorted by GDP is St. Kitts and Nevis.

Next we will find the average GDP rankings in our merged data for the "High income: OECD" and "High income: nonOECD" income groups: 


```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('Analysis3.R')
```

```{r Analysis3.R, eval=TRUE}

```

From the means of the filtered merge data we can see that the average GDP rankings of the High Income OECD is 32.97, and the average GDP rankings of the High Income Non OECD is 91.91.

Our next analysis will have is plot the GDP for all of the countries, color-coding the points by Income Group. We will show two different plots for our analysis, one with the x-axis grouped by country and the second with the x-axis grouped by Income Group.


```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('Analysis4.R')
```
This plot shows our countries from the GDP data on the x-axis and the GDP for that county on the y-axis with the color of each point representing its income group. 

```{r Analysis4.R, eval=TRUE}

```

This plot shows ourr countries from the GDP data on the x-axis and the GDP for that county on the y-axis with the color of each point representing its income group, but this time the countries are grouped by their income group from the educational data. 

A design decision was made to show the y-axis in logarithmic scale since some countries had a vastly higher GDP than most countries and the detail of the spread of the lower countries was lost, making the graphs less impactful since our goal is to see if a country's income group is somehow correlated to its GDP. Logarithmic scale makes these outliers less impactful in the skewing of the plots.

In the first plot it is difficult to see any correlation between the income groups and the GDP since the data is so scattered. The second plot was created in order to help groups the data for easier comparison.

The plots show a definite trend in certain income groups to have a higher average GDP. The means for the higher income groups are higher than the upper middle income group, which is higher than the lower middle income group, which is higher than the low income group. In addition, the mean GDP for the high income countries participating in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) seem to have a higher mean GDP than the high income countries not participating in the OECD. Lastly of note is that the spread, or deviation, in the lower middle and  upper middle income groups is much larger than the spread in the other groups, with the lower middle income group havig the most spread. It's difficult to derive many conclusions as to why that is, but suffice it to say that these income groups will not correlate as well with GDP.

More analysis would be necessary to draw any conclusions but the results are interesting and might warrant further investigation.

Lastly, we will cut the merged GDP rankings into 5 separate quantile groups and make a table of the rankings versus the income groups. We will use this table to tell us how many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest GDP:

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('Analysis5.R')
```

```{r Analysis5.R, eval=TRUE}

```

This Table shows the five income groups tracked in our educational data on the x-axis versus the ranking group of the country's GDP. Each individual cell show the number of countries in that income group and ranking group.
From this table we can see that 
The intersection of the top ranking group "(1,38.6]" and the "Lower middle income" group is 5, therefore there are 5 countries with Lower Middle income among the 38 nations with highest GDP in our dataset. Finding those countries in the merged data allows us to see these countries are China, Egypt, Indonesia, India and Thailand.

## Conclusion

Through the merging of the datasets and our analysis we were able to determine that here are 189 matching country codes between the two datasets. We were able to see that St. Kitts and Nevis has the 13th-highest GDP in our dataset, and that the average ranking for the countries assigned an income group of 'High Income: OECD' is 32.97 and for the income group of 'High Income: nonOECD' is 91.91.

Plotting and tables shows that a higher income group seems to correlate with a higher GDP.  Our quantile comparison shows 5 countries that have a Lower Middle income but fall into one of the 38 counties with the highest GDP, and they are China, Egypt, Indonesia, India and Thailand.

From our analysis we can see a probable correlation between GDP and income groups, as well as strong evidence that countries that High Income countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have, on average, a higher ranking when it comes to GDP than High Income countries that are not part of the OECD.

Since the OECD and income groups were not randomly assigned, we cannot use these data or analyses to determine causality, only a correlation. Furthermore since these data were not randomaly attained we cannot draw any conclusions about populations as a whole, only the 189 countries in both data sets involved in these analyses.
